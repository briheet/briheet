Yes, that pfp is me, apparently fueled by crazy dose of Jägermeister, would not recommend as a lifestyle, 11/10 experience.

## Hey there

<img src="/images/partywizard.gif" alt="Party wizard">

I’m Briheet Singh Yadav, sane human, currently powered by three minutes of sleep.

Born in [The Abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala). I spend most of my time thinking about various weird things that somehow may make sense.


I work as a software engineer specializing in backend systems. I use Golang, play with Zig in my free time and use C++ for competitive programming.

I listen to Linkin Park, Nirvana, $uicideboy$, VIOLENT VIRA and more. I have really weird taste in music and have never been able to relate with anyone. My fav rn [Now and at the Hour of Our Death](https://youtu.be/CcGgwIpl-cY?si=i_w4rB8H0PF7YaW6). Still lossless all the way yuhuuuu......

On the side, I am a big fan of G-Shocks (just bought a GA - B2100 - 1A1DR), beaches, food. I also have a knack for reading open source projects and writing performant systems, doing unnecessary profiling, etc.

I have lived about 1 year in Kerala, moved to Vizag (104 Naval Area) for 5 years, moved to Okha (Naval base) in Gujarat for 1 year, then moved to Mumbai (New/Old Navy nagar, Colaba) for 7 years, moved to Varanasi for 5 years.
