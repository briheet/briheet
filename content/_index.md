## Hey there

<img src="/images/partywizard.gif" alt="Party wizard">

I’m Briheet Singh Yadav, sane human, currently powered by three minutes of sleep.

Born in [The Abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala). I spend most of my time thinking about various weird things that somehow may make sense, which at the end is either solved or pretty illogical to begin with.


I work as a software engineer specializing in backend/low latency systems. I also work with gen-ai infra for media. I use Golang, play with Rust in my free time and use C++ for competitive programming, Nix for managing my nix-darwin/home manager setup.

I listen to Tame Impala, Linkin Park, Nirvana, $uicideboy$, VIOLENT VIRA, Evanescence and more. I have really weird taste in music and have never been able to relate with most. My fav rn [Now and at the Hour of Our Death](https://youtu.be/CcGgwIpl-cY?si=i_w4rB8H0PF7YaW6).

On the side, I am a big fan of G-Shocks (just bought a GA - B2100 - 1A1DR), beaches, food, sleep time. I also have a knack for reading open source projects and writing performant systems, doing unnecessary profiling, etc.

I have lived about 1 year in Kerala, moved to Vizag (104 Naval Area) for 5 years, moved to Okha (Naval base) in Gujarat for 1 year, then moved to Mumbai (New/Old Navy nagar, Colaba) for 7 years, moved to Varanasi for 5 years. Future plan on being a digital nomad for sometime.
