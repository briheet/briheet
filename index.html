      I use Arch Linux with i3wm as my daily driver and am pretty comfortable
      with it. With using it, i love to configure it according to my
      needs(mostly ricing and UI nothing else :>) ). I use Neovim :>) and tmux
      in my workflow. I am interested in Golang, Rust implemetations with
      problems arising in low level, devops. I am also Pupil @Codeforces.
