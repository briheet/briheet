    <h1 id="research-notes">Research Notes</h1>
<p>I want to build a persistent key-value store based on B-epsilon trees.
I looked at LevelDB but it&rsquo;s written in C++, which isn&rsquo;t my preference. So I decided to write this in Rust since I haven&rsquo;t touched it in a while.
I&rsquo;m also a bit tired of Go at this point due to its syntax, error handling, and GC overhead.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-lsm-trees">Understanding LSM Trees</h2>
<p>I started by learning about LSM trees. ScyllaDB has a good introductory article on it:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.scylladb.com/glossary/log-structured-merge-tree/">LSM Trees</a>: Solid article explaining LSM tree fundamentals</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree">LSM Wiki</a>: Wikipedia reference</li>
</ol>
<p>After reading through the material, I felt LSM trees were a solid solution,
but I wanted something more interesting to work on. So I started looking for alternative data structures or papers that might offer better approaches to this problem.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-b-epsilon-trees">Discovering B-epsilon Trees</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I found B-epsilon trees. They combine the write performance of LSM trees with the read performance of B-Trees. Here are some resources:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/06/29/b%ce%b5-tree-b-epsilon-tree-beta-epsilon-tree/">B-epsilon Tree Overview</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~bender/newpub/2015-BenderFaJa-login-wods.pdf">Academic Paper (Stony Brook)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This looks promising. Time to dig into B-epsilon tree implementations and try writing one in Rust.</p>
<h2 id="b-epsilon-implementation-in-rust">B-epsilon Implementation in Rust</h2>
<p>I went back to my competitive programming days for this. Although I was never great at competitive programming (terrible at remembering tricks), I loved implementing data structures from cp-algorithms.
So I started searching for articles and implementing.</p>
<p>Midway through, I learned about BetrFS which uses B-epsilon trees where epsilon is a tunable parameter, supposedly ranging between 0.3 and 0.5. I looked deeper and found TokuDB, which got acquired by Percona.
The interesting part is that it uses fractal trees, which from what I&rsquo;ve read are similar to B-epsilon trees, but the buffer structure differs.
In B-epsilon trees, if I understand correctly, the buffer size is B - B^e, which gives good flexibility for tuning. I&rsquo;ll find out if this understanding is correct as I go deeper.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the fractal tree source code: <a href="https://github.com/percona/PerconaFT">PerconaFT</a>.
The implementation is mainly in the <code>ft/</code> directory and appears to be largely unchanged from the original TokuDB implementation.
It&rsquo;s quite large and complex. Reading through this much C++ will be challenging, but I&rsquo;ll try to understand each operation one by one.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve read and watched a bunch of resources on this topic. Ig i&rsquo;ll have to do some more research on this, i am having a sleep call now :P</p>

        var tagNames = ['img', 'embed', 'object'];
        for (var i = 0; i < tagNames.length; i++) {
          center_el(tagNames[i]);
