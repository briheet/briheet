      <title>Building a Persistent KV Store with B-epsilon Trees</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;research-notes&#34;&gt;Research Notes&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to build a persistent key-value store based on B-epsilon trees.&#xA;I looked at LevelDB but it&amp;rsquo;s written in C++, which isn&amp;rsquo;t my preference. So I decided to write this in Rust since I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it in a while.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m also a bit tired of Go at this point due to its syntax, error handling, and GC overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-lsm-trees&#34;&gt;Understanding LSM Trees&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started by learning about LSM trees. ScyllaDB has a good introductory article on it:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-you-start&#34;&gt;Before You Start&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never had mentors, coaches, or seniors telling me what to do. Most of my knowledge comes from reading open source projects, source code, rewriting stuff on my own, reading blogs, watching conferences, picking up words, searching them, and going deep. The only hand I had from someone was my dad when I was 9-10, when he introduced me to terminals (that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another blog).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey, how&amp;rsquo;s it going? Hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing well ☺️&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Recently, a bunch of my friends hopped onto either MacOS or NixOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MacOS ones either did due to the fact their orgs provided them apple silicon, their daddy suddenly became rich or they somehow found a sugar momma/dada.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;NixOS ones did so either because they were long-time Arch users or just hopped onto the NixOS bandwagon because it’s cool (canon event).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, how are you guys doing ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently a bunch of college friends asked me about my experiences with Zig, and i&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, it&amp;rsquo;s been great.&#xA;I like using allocators, comptime and many other features. I also love &lt;strong&gt;Nix&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So one of them asked me if i could demonstrate him by building an application with it. I was like yea sure, i&amp;rsquo;ll write up a doc and share it with ya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
